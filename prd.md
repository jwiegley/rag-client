# Product Requirements Document: RAG Client Refactoring

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
This project involves refactoring the existing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) client codebase to align with Python best practices and leverage industry-standard libraries, while maintaining complete functional parity with the current implementation.

### 1.2 Objective
Transform the existing codebase into a well-structured, maintainable Python application that follows established conventions and utilizes best-in-class libraries, without altering any existing functionality or behavior.

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- Complete code restructuring to follow Python best practices (PEP 8, PEP 20)
- Migration to industry-standard Python libraries where appropriate
- Improved code organization and module structure
- Enhanced type hints and documentation
- Standardized error handling and logging
- Consistent naming conventions and code style

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- Adding new features or functionality
- Removing existing features
- Changing application behavior or output
- Modifying the core business logic
- Altering the API contract or CLI interface
- Performance optimizations that change behavior

## 3. Current State Analysis

### 3.1 Existing Architecture
The current application is a flexible Python RAG tool with:
- **Core Components**: main.py, rag.py, api.py, chat.py
- **Storage Options**: Ephemeral (in-memory) and persistent (Postgres/pgvector)
- **Interface Options**: CLI commands and OpenAI-compatible API
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration system
- **Dependencies**: llama-index framework with various provider extensions

### 3.2 Key Workflows
1. **Document Indexing**: Documents → Chunking → Embedding → Storage
2. **Query Retrieval**: Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Reranking → Context Assembly
3. **Response Generation**: Retrieved Context + Query → LLM → Response

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Code Organization
- **Requirement**: Restructure code into logical modules and packages
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Proper package structure with `__init__.py` files
  - Logical grouping of related functionality
  - Elimination of circular dependencies

### 4.2 Python Best Practices
- **Requirement**: Implement Python coding standards throughout
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - PEP 8 compliance for code style
  - PEP 484 type hints where appropriate
  - Proper use of Python idioms and patterns
  - Consistent error handling with appropriate exception types
  - Context managers for resource management

### 4.3 Library Standardization
- **Requirement**: Replace custom implementations with standard libraries
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Use of established libraries for common tasks
  - Proper dependency management
  - Removal of redundant or outdated dependencies
  - Consistent library usage patterns

### 4.4 Code Quality
- **Requirement**: Improve overall code quality and maintainability
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Elimination of code duplication
  - Proper abstraction and encapsulation
  - Clear and consistent naming conventions
  - Comprehensive docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
  - Removal of dead code and unused imports

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Backward Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Maintain 100% functional parity
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All existing CLI commands work identically
  - API endpoints produce identical responses
  - Configuration files remain compatible
  - All workflows produce the same results

### 5.2 Testing Validation
- **Requirement**: Ensure all tests pass post-refactoring
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Existing test suite passes without modification
  - `query-test.sh` executes successfully
  - No regression in functionality

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Maintainability
- Code should be easily understandable by Python developers
- Clear documentation of complex logic
- Modular design allowing for future extensions

### 6.2 Development Experience
- Consistent development patterns throughout the codebase
- Clear import structure
- Intuitive file and module organization

### 6.3 Dependencies
- Minimize dependency footprint where possible
- Use well-maintained, actively developed libraries
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.8+

## 7. Implementation Strategy

### 7.1 Approach
- Utilize python-pro agent for expert guidance on Python best practices
- Incremental refactoring to maintain stability
- Continuous validation through existing tests

### 7.2 Priority Areas
1. **High Priority**:
   - Core module restructuring (main.py, rag.py)
   - Standardization of error handling
   - Type hints and documentation

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Configuration management improvements
   - Logging standardization
   - Code duplication removal

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Minor style improvements
   - Optional dependency updates

## 8. Validation Criteria

### 8.1 Functional Testing
- All existing commands produce identical output
- API responses remain unchanged
- Configuration parsing works as before
- All supported workflows execute successfully

### 8.2 Code Quality Metrics
- Passes Python linting (pylint, flake8, or similar)
- Type checking passes (mypy or similar)
- No introduced bugs or regressions
- Improved code readability scores

## 9. Constraints

### 9.1 Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing configuration files
- Cannot break existing integrations or workflows
- Must preserve all CLI arguments and options
- API contract must remain identical

### 9.2 Implementation Constraints
- No functionality additions or removals
- Behavior must remain identical
- Testing must use existing test suite
- Changes must be reversible if issues arise

## 10. Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:
1. All existing tests pass without modification
2. The codebase follows Python best practices consistently
3. Code organization is logical and maintainable
4. Industry-standard libraries are used appropriately
5. All existing functionality works identically to before
6. The code is more readable and maintainable
7. Documentation accurately reflects the refactored structure

## 11. Risk Management

### 11.1 Identified Risks
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental changes with continuous testing
  
- **Risk**: Introducing incompatible library versions
  - **Mitigation**: Careful dependency management and testing

- **Risk**: Changing subtle behaviors unintentionally
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and validation

### 11.2 Rollback Strategy
- Version control with clear commit history
- Ability to revert to previous working state
- Preservation of original code structure until validation complete

## 12. Deliverables

1. Refactored codebase following Python best practices
2. Updated module structure with proper organization
3. Consistent use of industry-standard libraries
4. All existing tests passing
5. Preserved functionality across all features

## 13. Notes
